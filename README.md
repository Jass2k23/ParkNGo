# About the Web App

1. ParkNGo is a monorepo project with 4 frontend applications - Customer facing , Manager Application, Application for valets and application for admin.
2. Hosted the Customer, Manager, and Valet applications on Vercel; the Admin application remains unhosted due to Vercelâ€™s hosting limitations on the number of applications per GitHub repository.
3. Enabled users to search and book parking spots for various vehicle types (2-wheeler, 4-wheeler, heavy-duty vehicles) with scheduling options. Users can also book valets for vehicle pick-up and drop-off services.
4. Implemented a registration portal for valets to accept specific orders.
5. Provided an interface for admins to register and manage their garages with detailed information.
